    <h2>Solar Efficiency</h2>
    <p>Backy's solar panels are engineered to be highly efficient, ensuring that you can charge your devices on the go, even in low light conditions. Whether you're on a hike or in a city, Backy has you covered with solar energy wherever you are. Backy uses Polycrystalline to ensure the best of both efficiency, and longevity. However, If you wish to use a different solar-panel you are entitled to ask for a different option when ordering your Backy. Additionally, all solar-panels here are enhanced with Backy's secret sauce.</p>
