        <h2>About Mohamed</h2>
        <p>Hello sharks! My name is Mohamed, I'm from Cairo, Egypt. I like to code programs, among other things. I’m here to introduce Backy, a revolutionary Backpack that charges all your devices with a sleek, and discreet solar charger mounted at the rear of the backpack. I want you to invest in Backy, because it can help improve efficiency in all of our daily lives, and I hope soon that Backy can charge people's devices from all around the world, and a cleaner environment.</p>

        <h2>About Hatem</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Hatem I am a 13-year-old boy who wishes to be a pilot one day like my family I live in Cairo Egypt. I am here to introduce my creation, Backy It is a backpack that charges your device for you using a solar panel, and for that reason I think you should invest in Backy because imagine being on a long car ride and your devices are out of charge and you have nothing to do about it, but with Backy just plop it in there, and it will charge fully.</p>

        <h2>Why You Need Backy</h2>
        <p>Imagine heading to school and you are shoving your iPad in your bag so you can write notes in class, and when you arrive at class you realize that your iPad is dead, and you forgot your charger. Now imagine if your backpack could charge your devices for you.</p>

        <h2>Intro to Backy</h2>
        <p>Backy is an innovative product that will take the Backpack market share to the moon and beyond. It is also fully powered by solar renewable energy keeping earth as charged up as your devices. We plan to focus on mainly college students as a first step, but in the future we plan to introduce more Backy versions that fit into more people’s lives. Backy’s solar panel transfers solar energy into wireless chargers integrated in the fiber of the backpack, which means you can put your device into the backpack, and it will charge without any extra effort.</p>

        <h2>Backy’s Marketing</h2>
        <p>Our marketing strategy includes sponsoring influential creators on various social media platforms, and running ads on said social media platforms. This helps Backy gain a social media presence and brand recognition. This makes our customers feel a sense of trust with Backy.</p>

        <h2>Backy’s Financials</h2>
        <p>Additionally, we have managed to cut costs down to only 200$ per Backy sold, and 35$ labor costs, all without Backy cutting down on quality. We sell Backy for 300$ which makes us a profit of 65$ per Backy sold. However, we plan to lower costs soon, without loss of quality. Finally, we will be giving you the choice on what to invest, and what you want in return, if you wish to in invest please go to the "invest" tab in the navigation bar. We also have agreements with supermarkets that will sell our products.</p>

        <h2>Competition Against Backy</h2>
        <p>There are a lot of solar-powered backpacks in the market, but none of them quite like Backy. Backy doesn't have a thousand ports to plug your devices into; Backy has wireless chargers that can work with any phone rotation, so all you have to do is put your phone in the backpack in any of the pockets. We also prioritize the aesthetics of our backpack, ensuring that our Backpack looks good and charges your devices even better.</p>

        <h2>Backy’s Durability</h2>
        <p>Backy’s solar panel comes with a protective ceramic shield that protects the solar panel from all sorts of harm. The solar panel is also meticulously crafted to make sure it is in its lightest form. Additionally, a benefit we wish you never have to use is our service centers scattered around the US that will fix your Backy at the low cost of 15,000 EGP per Backy fixed.</p>

        <h2>Our Final Goodbyes</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, Backy is an innovative invention, that is far more superior than any of its competitors, with reasonable pricing that is expected to decrease. We have also established Backy’s durability, marketing, and financial strategy. We really hope you help us bring Backy to the whole world with your investment.</p>
